		  <p class="mb-4 larry text-lg md:text-xl ">
		  	Larry Itliong was born in Pangasinan, the Philippines on October 25, 1913, one of six children of Artemio and Francesca Itliong. He had arrived in the States at the age of fifteen on April 6, 1929 and immediately went to work in the fields. Then, turned to seasonal work to survive. He traveled from salmon canneries in Alaska to farm fields in Washington, Oregon, and California, which were often difficult and low-paying jobs.  
		  </p>
		  <p class="mb-4 text-lg md:text-xl ">
		  	His first take at labor organizing, was when he joined a strike in Washington state with the lettuce workers. Later, in the salmon canneries of Alaska he helped to organize the Alaska Cannery Workers Union. He was also involved in a failed asparagus strike in Stockton, California, in 1948, but by 1953 he was vice president of the Local 37 of the International Longshoremen's and Warehouse Workers Union, which was based in Seattle.
		  </p>
		  <p class="mb-4 text-lg md:text-xl">
		  	In 1959, the newly formed Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) to recruit him as a paid organizer because of his experience as an organizer and his deep ties to the Filipino community. It was there that he met Dolores Huerta, AWOC's secretary-treasurer, a Latino civil rights organization. Though Huerta left AWOC shortly after its founding after to join Cesar Chavez's National Farm Workers Association (NFWA). 
		  </p>
		  <p class="mb-4 text-lg md:text-xl"> In 1965, the bracero program had been a series of diplomatic agreements between the U.S. and Mexico allowing U.S. growers to hire and "import" Mexican workers, with supposedly guaranteed rights and a minimum wage. The government complied and restarted the program, with braceros making $1.40 per hour-and Filipino laborers making $1.25 or less.
		  </p>
		  <p class="mb-4 text-lg md:text-xl">The Filipino laborers turned to AWOC, Itliong's union, who permitted a strike; 10 days later, they were given equal wages. But the growers repeated the wage inequality farther north. By the time the fall harvest began in Delano, California, Filipino workers were earning only $1.00 per hour, and this time, the growers refused to reconsider. Workers turned to AWOC again.
		  </p>
		  <p class="mb-4 text-lg md:text-xl">On September 7, 1965, the Filipino workers voted to go on strike and for a week. There was no reason to believe other farm workers would join them. Growers had a history of pitting farm workers against each other on ethnic lines; hiring Latinos as scabs during Filipino strikes and vice versa. 
		  </p>

		  <p class="mb-4 text-lg md:text-xl">
		  	By the time the growers began evicting farm workers from grower-owned housing, Chavez and his union's board offered their support, and called a general meeting in Delano on September 16 to make it official. Cesar Chavez, Larry Itliong, and the other Latino and Filipino leaders of the UFW brought together the two races and cultures that growers had historically pitted against each other to break strikes.

		<div class="font-serif leading-normal mx-auto py-12 px-4 max-w-lg">
		  <p class="mb-4 text-lg md:text-xl">As assistant director of the UFWOC, Larry Itliong was Chavez's second-in-command, and he proved an able right-hand man. He personally answered many of the letters and donations that poured in to support the strike and traveled with other strikers all over the U.S. to spread the word and ask for support. He also took the lead on organizing a boycott of grapes; now considered one of the largest and most successful boycotts in U.S. history.
		  </p>
		  <p class="mb-4 text-lg md:text-xl">The strike and grape boycott lasted five years. In June 1969, grape growers reached out to the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee, indicating that they would consider negotiations, and in 1970, the strike finally ended. Itliong sat at the table beside Cesar Chavez as the union and growers signed the first contracts.
		  </p>
		  <p class=" text-lg md:text-xl">The United Farm Workers worked to ensure better conditions for farm laborers throughout California and beyond. The union created a standard contract that it presented to growers, with the threat of a strike or boycott should growers not accept it.

		  <p class=" quote ml-4 sm:ml-6 md:ml-8 lg:ml-10 mt-2 mb-2 pl-2  mr-5 font-bold  text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-2xl">
		      To tell you the truth. I've never taken the shit that I've been taking in this organization. But I do it because I think it's bigger than me for the farmworkers to have an organization.
		    </p>
		</div>

		<div class="font-serif leading-normal mx-auto py-12 px-4 max-w-lg">
		  <p class="mb-4 text-lg md:text-xl">The solidarity that sustained the strike didn't last for everyone once it was over. The UFW also did away with the labor contractor system the Filipino farm workers had used for decades, and with Latinos outnumbering Filipinos in the new union, many Filipinos worried they would be ignored. Many of the Filipino AWOC members eventually left for other trade unions.
		  </p>
		  <p class="mb-4 text-lg md:text-xl">Itliong left the UFW in October 1971, when he began to question the direction of the union. Itliong then founded the Filipino American Political Association. He also focused on improving life for aging Filipinos. Itliong and others had dreamed of a home where these men could live comfortably in retirement. Before he left the UFW, Itliong had left behind plans for a retirement home. The union took these plans and turned them into Paolo Agbayani Village, named after a farm worker who suffered a heart attack and died on the picket line. When finished the Agbayani Village had 60 apartments, a communal kitchen, a garden, and more.
		  </p>
		  <p class="mb-4 text-lg md:text-xl">Agbayani Village still stands today at the Forty Acres in Delano, the original headquarters of the UFW, though it no longer has residents. The Forty Acres, including Agbayani Village and other buildings at the site, is now a National Historic Landmark and can be visited year-round.</p>
