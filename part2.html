		  	Born in 1904 in the barrio of Saoang, Ilocos Sur, Philip Vera Cruz was part of the generation of the early Filipina/o American pioneers who arrived in the United States in the 1920s and early 1930s when the Philippines was still under American colonial rule. Vera Cruz came to the U.S. in 1926, entering through Seattle, Washington.In the first several years that Vera Cruz was in the U.S., the bulk of his time was devoted to "surviving" through regular labor migration and sending remittances back home to the Philippines to aid in the support of his family.
		  </p>
		  <p class="mb-4 text-lg md:text-xl ">As part of this sacrifice, Vera Cruz also put aside his hopes of getting a university education or starting his own family.10 With World War II, Vera Cruz left Chicago for Delano, California and became an agricultural laborer.
		  </p>
		  <p class="mb-4 text-lg md:text-xl ">Vera Cruz turned to union work as "an outlet to do something meaningful for myself as well as for my fellow workers." He was a veteran of different strikes, including a major asparagus strike in the Stockton area. In those years, labor agitation was regular, but not sustained, and typically consisted of halting work for a few days for improvements in pay and labor conditions. Toward the end of the 1950s, he became a member of the National Farm Labor Union, and even was a president of the Delano local. He recalled that the majority of its members were Filipina/o, with some Mexican and African American representation. </p>
		  <p class="mb-4 text-lg md:text-xl ">As an agricultural worker during this period, Vera Cruz watched as the composition of the farmworker force shifted. Through the early 1960s, thousands of Mexican workers continued to enter the U.S. at minimal wages through the bracero program, which ran from 1942 to 1964, adding to an already sizeable labor pool of Mexican and Mexican American farmworkers. Later, after the bracero program concluded, a number of these laborers came back to the U.S. to continue working. Conditions for agricultural workers in general were characteristically marginal, increasing the profits going to the agricultural owners.</p>
		  <p class="mb-4 text-lg md:text-xl ">The immediate history of the strike starts in 1959, when the AFL-CIO organized the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) in Stockton, with Filipina/o American and Chicano/a leaders including Larry Itliong, Ben Gines, and Andy Imutan, as well as Refugio Hernandez and Pete Manuel. Philip Vera Cruz was also a member, one of the many Filipina/o Americans represented in the organization.  
		  </p>
		  <p class="mb-4 text-lg md:text-xl ">Three years after the AWOC was formed, the National Farm Workers Association was set up in Delano by César Chávez, Dolores Huerta, Gilbert Padilla, and others, and was a primarily Chicano/a organization. The initial walkout that began the strike occurred on September 8, 1965, when farmworkers in the Delano area, predominantly Filipina/o American, voted to strike against the grape growers. They sought a ten-cent increase per hour in pay, so that they would make $1.40 an hour, the same wage that Willard Wirtz, U.S. secretary of labor, advocated for Mexican braceros.
		  </p>
		  <p class="mb-4 text-lg md:text-xl "> Vera Cruz contends that the Filipina/os were aware of the power of the strike and "had a strong labor consciousness" from more than four decades of laboring in the United States. While they largely formed a generational cohort in terms of their age and the number of years they had been in the U.S., they drew from a wide base of experience because of their diverse educational and employment backgrounds. For example, they were highly attuned to the business of agriculture, and their class consciousness included analysis of the economy for which they labored. The workers, Vera Cruz notes, knew the "prices and profits" because they followed "market reports on the radio and then discussed these reports in Ilocano, our dialect." 20 This workers' consciousness contributed to their ability to organize.</p>
		

		<p class="mb-4 text-lg md:text-xl "> In the years of striking that would ensue, Filipina/o American laborers would work regularly with Chicano/a laborers in these political struggles. Because Chicano/as were the dominant group of workers in the fields, they had several decades of experience in dealing with California agribusiness, with a long history of resistance in the fields. As historians like Gilbert González and Camille Guerin-Gonzales have shown, they brought a wealth of knowledge and experience to the labor struggle, and it is impossible to fully understand the labor situation of Filipina/o American agricultural workers without placing it in the context of the history of Chicano/a agricultural workers. 21 This said, however, it is also crucial to point out some key differences in their experience.</p>

		<div class="font-serif leading-normal mx-auto py-12 px-4 max-w-lg">
		<p class="mb-4 text-lg md:text-xl "> On September 16, 1965, eight days after the walkout began, the three year old National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) decided to support the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee strike. 24 Three days later, the NFWA and the AWOC created a joint strike committee in Delano. 25 The AWOC strike in Coachella was successful, although Vera Cruz called it "in retrospect a half-victory." While the workers won more pay, they did not secure a contract, and so their union was not fully recognized by the growers.</p>

		<p class="mb-4 text-lg md:text-xl ">The events that Vera Cruz witnessed took place in an ever-widening arena of struggle. In July 1968, a national boycott for California table grapes as a whole was started, which grew to an international scale, with special attention directed to the Philippines, which ranked third in terms of the importation of grapes. 34 By June 1970, with added pressure from the international boycott campaign, the union was able to claim contracts for about six million cartons of grapes in Arizona and California, with control over twenty percent of the crops in the Delano vicinity, sixty percent in Arvin, and sixty-five percent in Coachella valley.
		</p>

		<p class="mb-4 text-lg md:text-xl ">One of the most significant aspects of the union was its organization across race. Analyzing this coalition of agricultural laborers in the UFW over a period of twenty years, roughly from 1959 when the AWOC was first established to the end of the 1970s after César Chávez's trips to Mexico and the Philippines, enables us to chart a critical time in the formation of the union, a time when great changes in the American culture would be reflected in the union's history.</p>
